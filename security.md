In this project, I considered common security threats that many backend applications face. 2 of the main threats I found were insecure handling of user input and the risk of exposing sensitive credentials. One threat is accepting user input directly without validation. This can lead to issues such as injection attacks (where people can access or delete your database data without permission) or broken data. While my current backend does not implement full input validation, I am aware that this can be mitigated by adding validation logic tools that I found like express-validator or manual checks before saving data to the databases.
Another potential vulnerablility is exposing sensitive information like databases credentials. For example putting sensitive things like passwords or database URLs directly in the code and then uploading the code somewhere, anyone could then access that sensitive information. To mitigate this I used environment variables with the dotenv package that allows me to load important values into my code instead of hardcoding sensitive values into the code. This protects my database connection string and makes the app more secure.
An improvement could be to implement rate limiting and basic authentication to prevent abuse and improve the overall security of the API.
