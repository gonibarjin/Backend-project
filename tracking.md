i implemented Google Analytics in my project to track basic user interaction. Specifically, it records when users visit the site and when the click certain buttons or submit entries. These events are tracked using gtag() and tracking code is placed in relevant event handlers for example onClick.
I chose Google Analytics because it is widely used, easy to set up and gives valuable insight into how users interact with the website. It helps identify popular features and understand what content users engage with the most.
To respect privacy and follow GDPR guidelines, I made sure to avoid collecting or storing pesonally identifiable information. I have also implemented a cookie consent banner using the react-cookie-consent library to let users know that tracking is in use and is only activated after the user has accepted cookies.
