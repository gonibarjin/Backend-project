This project is built with accesibility and SEO in mind. The HTML structure uses semantic elements such as main, header, section and article to provide clear content regions. This helps screen readers navigate the page more effectively and improves SEO indexing.
Each form input has a proper label element linked vie htmlFor, which is crucial for screen readers. Buttons have a descriptive aria-label attributes when needed, especially for dynamic content like editing or deleting entries.
The heading structure follows a logical hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) to clearly organize content. This not only helps users scan the page quickly but also gives search engines better context.
The list of entries is rendered inside a ul element with individual entries wrapped in li and article tags ensuring semantic clarity.
SEO score in Lighthouse was also dramatically improved by adding a descriptive meta name="description" tag in the HTML head to help search engines understand the purpose of the site.
