I started by running a Lighthouse report in Chrome DevTools to identify performance issues. The initial performance score was 67, and the main issue was a high Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) due to the form being pushed down when the entries loaded.
To fix the layout shift, I moved the "Add New Entry" form into a modal that appears when a button is clicked. This eliminated the shifting content and instantly improved the performance score from 67 to 90.
I also installed and used vite-plugin-inspect to analyze bundle sizes and inspect which files were contributing the most unused JavaScript. This gave me insights into which parts of the website were heavier and helped confirm that main.jsx was taking 1.1 seconds to load, mainly due to module imports.
I noticed that Tailwind CSS was included in the project even though I wasn't using it. I removed it from both package.json and vite.config.js to reduce the amount of unused CSS and JavaScript in our final bundle.
While some recommendations like "Reduce Unused JavaScript" remained unresolved, I learned how to interpret these suggestions and explored potential solutions using modern tools. Since performance perfection wasn't the goal, I prioritized understanding and improving where possible.
